<p><strong>Objective</strong></p>
<p>Change the logic of the form validations</p>
<p><strong>Problem Definition</strong></p>
<p>In this test, you are given a simple Signup page. The page has 3 fields: name, email, and password. The Signup page is already working. Test it out!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the form validation errors are displayed only on the click of the submit button. Your assignment is to change the logic such that the validation errors, if any, are displayed once the respective control loses focus.</p>
<p>Eg: If the user types an invalid email address, the corresponding error should be displayed as soon as the user shifts control from the email field.</p>
